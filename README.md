Simple Construction For Kerbal Space Program

Originally created by MatterBeam

Description
After testing out Extraplanetary Launchpads and Roverdude's MK/OKS, I had the idea of creating a simple, user friendly mod that would allow you to build rockets without taking a 200MB hit to RAM or having to juggle multitudes of resource pathways. If you know how to set up a drill, ISRU and a fuel tank for an Ore to Fuel conversion, then you should know how to build rockets.

Features
No extra parts
No RAM usage
Added functionality for the Mobile Processing Lab in the late game
Simple, configurable and adds levels of depth to the gameplay without a learning curve
